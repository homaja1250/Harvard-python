| final project| The Task Management Program is a simple Python application that allows users to manage their to-do list. Users can add tasks, remove tasks by specifying their number, and view all tasks in the list. The program is implemented with a main function and three additional functions: add_task, remove_task, and view_tasks. Each function handles a specific aspect of task management, providing an easy-to-use command-line interface.
